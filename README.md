# Digital Marketing A/B Testing Analysis

## Business Context

A marketing company is evaluating the effectiveness of its digital advertising campaign through an A/B test. The experiment compares user behavior between two groups:
- Ad Group: Users exposed to advertisements
- PSA Group: Users exposed to public service announcements

The goal is to determine whether the advertisements drive better conversion performance compared to PSAs and to derive actionable insights to optimize future campaigns.
